        next state in a list of states you supply without having to implement
        client side logic to calculate the next state in the sequence.

        For example, you can have a hardware button that will cycle through a
        few different brightness settings and off by simply binding a button
        press to send an identical Cycle request, and the API figures out the
        rest.

        The API scores each state hash against the current states of all the
        lights in the selector, and if the score is high enough to be
        considered a match, it will apply the next state in the list,
        looping back to the first one if necessary. If there's no close match,
        it will apply the closest state to the selector.

        The maximum of 5 states was selected so a user would not have to press
        a button more than 6 times to achieve their desired state.

        The optional direction parameter determines the direction the API uses
        to determine the next state.

        If you have a scenario where the Cycle API does not work as expected,
        please let us know on the forums.
